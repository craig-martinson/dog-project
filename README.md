# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project developed for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the app will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the app will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Getting Started
